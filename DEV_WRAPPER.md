# Universal `./dev` Wrapper

This project uses a **universal development wrapper** (`./dev`) that provides a consistent interface across different technology stacks.

## Quick Start

```bash
./dev setup    # Install dependencies
./dev build    # Build the project
./dev test     # Run tests
./dev lint     # Run linters
./dev start    # Start dev server/app
```

## What is `./dev`?

The `./dev` script is a **polyglot dispatcher** that automatically detects your project's tools and routes commands accordingly:

- **Python projects**: Delegates to `dev_agent`, `pip`, or `pytest`
- **Node.js projects**: Routes to `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`
- **Rust projects**: Uses `cargo`
- **Make-based projects**: Calls `make` targets
- **Hybrid projects**: Intelligently combines multiple tools

## Available Commands

Run `./dev` with no arguments to see detected capabilities and available commands.

### Standard Commands

| Command | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `setup` | Install all dependencies | `./dev setup` |
| `build` | Build/compile the project | `./dev build` |
| `test` | Run test suite | `./dev test` |
| `lint` | Run code linters | `./dev lint` |
| `typecheck` | Run type checking | `./dev typecheck` |
| `clean` | Clean build artifacts | `./dev clean` |
| `start` | Start application/server | `./dev start` |

### Project-Specific Commands

The wrapper also forwards project-specific commands:
- **NPM scripts**: Any script in `package.json` (e.g., `./dev watch`)
- **Make targets**: Any target in `Makefile` (e.g., `./dev deploy`)
- **Cargo commands**: Standard Rust commands (e.g., `./dev check`)

## Runtime Detection

The wrapper detects your toolchain **at runtime** (every time you run it), which means:

1. **No configuration needed**: Drop `./dev` into any project
2. **Adapts to changes**: Add a `Makefile` later? It just works
3. **Multi-language support**: Python + Node.js? Both work

## Generating the Wrapper

If your project doesn't have `./dev` yet, you can generate it:

```bash
# Via Warp Agent (recommended)
# Enter the project directory and ask:
# "Bootstrap this project with a universal ./dev wrapper"

# Or manually (if you have cf-bootstrap-dev.sh):
~/Library/Application\ Support/dev.warp.Warp-Preview/mcp/tools/cf-bootstrap-dev.sh .
```

## Philosophy

This wrapper embodies the principle: **"One command to rule them all."**

Whether you're working on Python, Node, Rust, or a polyglot project, `./dev` provides a consistent, predictable interface that:
- Reduces cognitive load
- Accelerates onboarding
- Eliminates "how do I run this?" questions
- Works identically for humans and AI agents

## Examples

### Python Project
```bash
./dev setup     # → pip install -r requirements.txt
./dev test      # → pytest
```

### Node.js Project
```bash
./dev setup     # → npm ci
./dev lint      # → npm run lint
./dev typecheck # → npm run type-check
```

### Rust Project
```bash
./dev setup     # → cargo fetch
./dev build     # → cargo build
./dev test      # → cargo test
```

### Hybrid Project (Python + Node)
```bash
./dev setup     # → npm ci && pip install -r requirements.txt
./dev build     # → npm run build
./dev test      # → pytest (or npm test, depending on priority)
```
